        <h3>The new policy allows employees to temporarily opt for reduced working hours to focus on personal priorities</h3>
        <div>As part of its ongoing efforts to introduce progressive policies and enable better work-life balance, Amazon India has introduced a new part-time work arrangement policy starting November 2021. The new policy enables employees to avail of reduced working hours in order to focus on personal priorities. Employees can temporarily request to work fewer hours after prior discussions with their managers and HR.</div>

    <br /><br />    <p>The policy is an expression of trust in employees' professionalism and does not compromise on performance and accountability. While goals will be adjusted basis the reduced hours, the policy ensures that customer expectations are not compromised.

Amazonâ€™s temporary part-time policy is, of course, governed by reasonable conditions and based on business priorities. All aspects of the benefits and policy have been well thought through and ensure that career progression and internal movements to other roles are not affected either; employees can pursue career growth irrespective of the hours at work. Career growth remains based on how an employee demonstrates the leadership principles and next-level competencies.</p>
